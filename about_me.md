I  was born and raised in Dubai, UAE, and really enjoy exploring the cosmos both by way of code and the imagination. I recently graduated from the American University of Sharjah with a double major in Physics and Electrical Engineering. There, I mostly worked on various aspects of multi-messenger astrophysics. In the fall, I'll be starting my PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics at Harvard University, working within the joint Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. You can find my CV <a href="../cv/CV.pdf">here</a>.
