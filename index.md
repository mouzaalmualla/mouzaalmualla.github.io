# About Me
{:center}
### Hi! I'm an undergraduate at the American University of Sharjah double majoring in Physics and Electrical Engineering. I was born and raised in Dubai, UAE, and dedicate most of my time to research in astrophysics. In the fall, I'll be starting my PhD in astrophysics at Harvard University. You can find my CV <a href="./cv/CV.pdf">here</a>.
